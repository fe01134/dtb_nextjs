The beach experiences in Algarve can vary drastically in it's short 300 Kilometers of coastline.  From cliff, barrier and cave beaches are some of the types of beaches that you can visit within a short driving distance of each other.  The list of beaches below allows you to experience all these types of beaches. Plan on spending at least a half a day at the beach to really experience all they have to offer.  Cliff, cave and barrier beaches are sometimes only accessible via paddle board, kayaks or boat.  Other beaches you can simply drive to and there is almost alway free parking.  People watching beaches are likely the ones you can easily get access do via car and parking.   Cliff beaches in July and August often fill up quickly making it difficult to find a place to lay your beach blanket and enjoy the beach.   

If looking for a place to live access to beaches and how crowded they get may influence your decision.   The types of activities you enjoy may also influence your base location.
