The Algarve is a fantastic destination for bird watching, particularly for those interested in seeing flamingos, storks, and various coastal birds. Here’s a guide to the best spots along the Algarve coast for birdwatching, including details on the best times to visit these locations.  You can check ebird.com for sightings.
  

## When to visit?

The best time of year to flamingo watch and find flamingos present are from late summer to early spring. Spring and autumn are ideal as they coincide with migration periods.  Storks and other birds can be seen year-round.
The best time of day to see them when they are present is early morning, dusk and before the area gets busy.
