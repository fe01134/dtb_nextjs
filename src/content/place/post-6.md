One of the more secluded beaches in Carvoeiro.  An easy walk from downtown Carvoeiro which was ormerly a fisherman village. It now caters vistors from all over the world who want to enjoy the Sun.  Families will enjoy Carvoeiro, especially those from the UK which seem to represent a large majority of the vistors and residents.   Praia de Paraiso is a short walk from down town Carvoeiro and Carvoeiro beach.  While the walk up the hill from downtown and then steps down to the Praia de Paraiso is great workout, it's also a beautiful secluded oasis.  Expecially in the non summer months.  The beach gets its name from the area which is called Quinta do Paraiso.  It is a sought after location for people looking to move to Carvoeiro.   If you are staying in downtown Carvoeiro and even if your not I highly recommend checking out this beach.   Be careful when you get to the bottom of the steps.  The step ladders at the base of the beach have been damaged and some of the stpes are missing or loose.  People with less mobility may have to pass on this beach.  The beach is small so don't come with lots of stuff.  

While rock falls rarely happen in the summer it is worth considering not laying your blanket next to the cliffs just to be safe.  The beach has a large iconic cliff column jetting out in the middle of the beach area.  


## Good to know

### Where to eat?

While the Praia de Paraiso beach doesn't has a restaurant, there is a beautiful scenic restaruant at the top of the steps that lead down down the beach.  The restauruant is relatively expensive for Portuguese standards but it's convience and views make it worth while for special occassions. 


### Parking

Praia de Paraiso has very extremely limited parking.  The street access is through a residential area and very narrow which also limits street parking.  Like most of Downtown Carvoeiro come early to get a parking space in the summer.  Best to find parking off the main the road futher back from the coast on the hills in town. 


### Surf

Good for cooling off and families to enjoy the water.   The beach is rather extremely small.   Large elevation drop downto the beach.  Waves tend to come in multiple directions given the beaches very small width.  This makes it difficult to enter and exit the beach with waves comging from multiple directions as they bounce off the cliff walls. Not good for surfing given its narrow width.


### How Busy

Like some other cliff beaches it can get very tight for a place to lay your beach blanket in the summer, especially during high tide.  You can have it to your self in the fall, winter and spring as it seems very few people either know about the beach or don't have the strength to climb up the hill, step down to and back up from the beach. Finally, to walk back down the hill to Carvoeiro beach.


### Activities

Plenty of activities to do at Paraiso beach.

- **Swimming**:
- **Sun Bathing**: Listening and watching the surf come in.
- **Picnicing**: On the beach. 
- **Watching Sunrises and Sunsets**: Some amazing views from the tops of the cliffs. Towards the west of Algarve you can see the sun set.   Towards the east of Algarve you can see the sun rise.  
- **Walks**:  It is a short walk to Carvoeiro beach from here.  Consider going there by foot down the hitll to Carvoeiro beach.  Use an Ube to get to the beach if you don't want to deal with the hills.   Uber rides for short distances are very inexpensive in Algarve.
