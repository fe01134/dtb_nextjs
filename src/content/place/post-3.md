Great for families with spectacular views of the Rocha Negra cliff.   Plenty of walks to keep the family busy through the entire day at the beach.  A promoneda with Palm trees provides nice cafes to just hang out and people watch while having a bite to eat and a drink.

## Good to know

> Restuarant:  A variety of cafes and restaurants are available by the beach and on the promenade the runs along the beach.  You can buy drinks, ice cream and sandwiches there.

> Parking:  Beach has very limited parking.  The street access is through a residential areas and very narrow which also limits street parking.  Come early to get a parking space in the summer.

> Surf:  Good for cooling off and families to enjoy the water.   The beach is wide and deep so can accomodate lots of people.

> Water sports:  Good for surfing. As you get further west in Algarve the wind picks up as do the waves.  The beach is dood for swimming.  They also offer surfing lessons here.

> How busy:  Like some other cliff beaches it can get tight for a place to lay your beach blanket in the summer, especially during high tide.

> Activities:  Swimming, sunbathing, surfing, picnicing on the beach and watching sunsets.  Its a short walk to to Rocha Negra Cliff walk from the  beach.  Consider going a short climb to the top of the cliff walk.   You can sometimes see powered para sails flying along the cliffs and beaches there.  Be very careful walking along the cliffs as very few areas are actually fenced.

> Cost:  Pay to park in the parking area by the beach.  Although if you search long enough you can find parking along the streets.
