I am guessing Portugal probably has more cafe's per person in the world.  Even the smallest villages will often have more than one cafe.  Here are a couple of my favourates in Carvoeiro that provide unique experience,  some great coffee, and people watching.  My goto coffee is a "galao" (late) and a "tosta mista" ("toasted ham and cheese melt"). If you like your coffee strong you can get a "bica" (small expresso)  ca stands for "com acucar" (with sugar)
  
## My Favorates

Here are some of my favorates to visit. 

### Earth

 Has a really comfortable vibe. Offers indoor seating with surprising views of the sea even though its on the main road of dowtown Carvoeiro.  After people watching and your coffee you can even shop some of the unique gifts to bring home for family and friends.

Location: Right on the main road downtown. 

Parking: Parking facilities are available on the street however it is difficult to find spot in the summer.  Consider going back off road into the resort or behind the hotels or towards the ocean and Algar Seco.
