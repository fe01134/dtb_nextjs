Marina that was excavated into the cliffs west of the main beaches of Albufeira. As a result it is well protected from ocean wave actions. It is in a valley.  As a result of it's location, there is very little sea breezes that make their way back into the Marina.  It can get extremely hot in the summer.  \n\nThe Marina offers many activities including:\n\n- Excursions.  Explore the stunning coastline with a variety of boat tours available at the Marina. You can choose from relaxing sightseeing tours, dolphin watching excursions, or adventurous water sports including jet skiing and parasailing.\n\n- Shops, Restuarants and Bars.  You will find lots of quaint cafes, restaurants and shops along the perimeter of the marina.

You can have a drink, eat and shop at while you wait for you time slot for your excursions.  Some places do offer live entertainment in the evening in the summer.  .\n\n\n## Good to know\n\n### Where to eat?\n\nThe marina has many sit down restaurants and bars that overlook the Marina.   If you book an excursion they sometime offer drink discounts to the local marina bars and restaurants.  Checkin first with your excursion before you vist the bars and restaurants for your trip to take advantage of the discounts.\n\n\n### Parking\n\nThe marina has dedicated paid parking lots. The parking is close to the marina and available even in the summer busy periods.

The Marina is an in rock enclosed break water bay and protected from the ocean waves.\n\n### How Busy\n\nYou can usually find a place to park your car on the street or available parking lots even in the summer.  \n\n\n### Activities\n\nThere are plenty of excursions and activities to do at the Marina.\n\n- Boat Tours and ecursions of the Algarve Coastline.  The boats are depart from the docs in the marina. The tour provides excellent tours of the Benegil cave, Dolphins or whale watching.  The larger boats depart from this Marina which makes it unlikely you will be able to get onto the beach like Carvoeiro boat tours that allow visitors to see the cave from sandy beach inside the Benegil cave opening.  Advance booking is recommended, especially in August, as this is peak tourist season. Look for combo deals to enjoy multiple activities at a reduced rate. Call ahead and ask for early morning when is less hot or later in the afternoon to see sun sets.  In the winter and spring there are fewer people.  The water is colder and the waves bigger and greater chance of rain making it not worthwhile to book ahead but rather just calling to ahead that morning to see if they have opening that you can book when your arrive.  What to consider:\n\n    - While some of the boats offer jackets to protect you from the waves splashing onto you they sometimes don't have zippers that work. Consider bringing your own plastic ponchoes if you don't want to get wet.\n    - Make sure you go to the bathroom before you depart on your boat tour. Only some boats offer bathrooms.  The boats that do offer bathrooms may not make them available if the seas are too rough.\n\n\n- Parasailing can fit typically fit upto three people on an excursion.  Someone can join you and film from the boat.   The parasail lifts up from the take off and landing pad on the back of the boat.  The sail boat captain will intentionally slow dow the boat while in you are being towed so that you can dip your toes in the water.  This and the landing when you are rewound back to the take off and landing pad makes for a thrilling experience for the adventerous.\n\n- Snorkling some of the boat tours do offer snorkling at only boat accessible beaches.   Benegil Cave tour is a  must-see natural attraction.  The caves are accessible only by water. Tours usually depart from Albufeira Marina and include stops for swimming and snorkeling.  What to bring: \n    - Swimwear\n    - Sunblock\n    - A waterproof camera to capture the stunning rock formations and azure waters.\n\n- Water sports.  Go tubing or Rent jet skis.   Jetskis can be rented for one driver or one driver and passenger.  You typically are limited to go around in a single direction on the bouys positioned in the near by waters for a specific time period.   Many excersions also offer action pictures of you riding the jet skies or while being pulled by a motor boat tubing.\n\n- Swimming is not available at the Marina.\n\n- Sunbathing. Listening and watching the boats come into the marina from dock and people watching are great activities from an outdoor covered bar or restaurant in the Marina perimeter.\n\n\n- Take a walk along the rock break water bay.  Offers some nice views of the sea and the marina.  Bring your fishing pole and do some fishing off the rock break water pier.  \n\n\n### Cost\n\nSee the excursion provider for costs.  You also have to pay for parking.\n\n\n### Restrooms\n\nMany of the restaurants and bars offer bathrooms. Make sure to go to the bathromm before boat and jet ski excursions.

Just like one of the 7 wonders of the world, Niagra Falls,  I have been there a couple of times and have no desire to go back.   The beach isn't known for its beautiful beach experiences but rather the famous Benegil Cave which is accessible via paddle board and rentable Kayaks at the beach.   One of the most busiest beaches in Lagoa makes this not that great of an experience. Very narrow streets and sidewalks making walking down from the crowded parking lots difficult.  Families will be too worried about their children getting run over by the passing cars getting to and returning from the beach.  Praia de Benegil is picturesq, but the crowds take away from it's experience.   The becaa short walk from down town Carvoeiro and Carvoeiro beach.

A short drive inland and you will find a gourmet hamburger restaurant and churasqueira (flame grilled) chicken.  \n\n\n### Parking\n\nPraia de Benegil has a substantial parking lot that is usually at capacity in the summer months.  The street access is through a residential area and very narrow which also limits street parking.  Like most of the beaches in Lagoa come early to get a parking space in the summer.  Best to find parking off the main the road futher back in the linked together dirt and paved parking lots. \n\n\n### Surf\n\nGood for cooling off and seeing one of the top wonders of Alarve.   The beach is rather good size.   Large elevation drop downto the beach.  Waves tend to come in multiple directions given the beaches very small width.  This makes it difficult to enter and exit the beach with waves comging from multiple directions as they bounce off the cliff walls. Not good for surfing given its narrow width.\n\n\n### How Busy\n\nUnlike some other cliff beaches it doesn't get tight for a place to lay your beach blanket in the summer because most of the visitors are they to access the Benegil Cave.  Even in the winter and spring there are plenty of people which means this isn't the place to come for solitude or being secluded.  Unfortunately to man people know about the Benegil beach and cave.  Once you've experienced the beach and feel like checking out another beachs climb up the hill eastward along the cliff walk to Prai de Carvalho.  If you don't feel like swimming, paddle boarcing or Kayaking to the beach to exprience the Benegil cave consider checking it out from above.  Walk back up the hill to the right into the parking area along the cliff walk eastward.   You will come to the Benegil Cave opening that is fenced off.   These surface cave opening exist and are viewable along multiple cliff beaches in Algarve.  \n\n\n### Activities\n\nPlenty of activities to do at Bengil beach.\n\n- Swimming - I wouldn't recommend this beach for swimming given that the waves here can be treacherous even in the summer.  Avoid swimming in the boat ramp where there are usually dozens of kayakers making their way into the water to paddle over to Benegil Cave.   I wouldn't risk trying to swim to the Benegil cave given how busy the entrance to the cave is with boat and kayak traffic. \n- Sunbathing.\n- Picnicing on the beach. \n- Watching sunrises and sunsets. Some amazing views from the tops of the cliffs. Towards the west of Algarve you can see the sun set.   Towards the east of Algarve you can see the sun rise.  \n- Walks.  If you get bored with Benegil beach, it's a short walk west Carvalho beach from here.  Consider going there by foot up the cliff walk way westward along Cliff.  It's also a short walk east to Praia de Marinha which was voted one of the top 10 beaches in all of Europe.  Use an Uber to get to the beach if you don't want to deal with the hills.   Uber rides for short distances are very inexpensive in Algarve.  Walk to to the top of the eastern side of Benegil beach cliffs to check out the Benegil cave from above. Be careful not to get to close to the cliff edges and cave openings. \n- People watching.  It can be entertaining watching the kayakers entering the water and trying not to get wiped out by the big waves. \n- Kayaking and standup paddle boarding.   With easy access to Benegil Cave it makes it appealing.  The craziness of dozenss of people trying to enter the waters and avoiding the tour boats will make you think twice about it.   Recently a kayaker was injured and the local government has passed new laws to limit the number of Kayak rentals that are allowed in the area. Carefully consider the risks injury as a result of kayaking with large boats around you with large waves before you choose this activity.\n\n### Cost\n\nFree.\n\n### Restrooms\n\nThere are a couple of small public bathrooms at the entrance to the beach."},{"group":"place","slug":"place/post-8","frontmatter":{"title":"Praia de Carvoeiro","meta_title":"Old fishing town Cliff beach in Downtown Carvoeiro Algarve Portugal","description":"Cliff beach located Carvoeiro near Vale de Milho","date":"2024-04-07T05:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/beaches/carvoeiro.jpg","locations":["Lagoa","Carvoeiro","Downtowan Carvoeiro"],"trip":"Add Me","tags":["sunrise","swimming","sunset","beach"],"draft":false,"activity":"Beach"},"content":"\nCarvoeiro beach is one of the my favorate beaches in Carvoeiro.
