Plenty of walks to keep the family busy through the entire day at the beach.

You can buy drinks, ice cream and sandwiches there.\n\n> Parking:  Beach has very limited parking.  The street access is through a residential areas and very narrow which also limits street parking.  Come early to get a parking space in the summer.\n\n> Surf:  Good for cooling off and families to enjoy the water.   The beach is wide and deep so can accomodate lots of people.\n\n> Water sports:  Good for surfing. As you get further west in Algarve the wind picks up as do the waves.  The beach is dood for swimming.  They also offer surfing lessons here.\n\n> How busy:  Like some other cliff beaches it can get tight for a place to lay your beach blanket in the summer, especially during high tide.\n\n> Activities:  Swimming, sunbathing, surfing, picnicing on the beach and watching sunsets.  Its a short walk to to Rocha Negra Cliff walk from the  beach.  Consider going a short climb to the top of the cliff walk.   You can sometimes see powered para sails flying along the cliffs and beaches there.  Be very careful walking along the cliffs as very few areas are actually fenced.\n\n> Cost:  Pay to park in the parking area by the beach.  Although if you search long enough you can find parking along the streets.\n"},{"group":"place","slug":"place/post-4","frontmatter":{"title":"Praia Vale Centeanes","meta_title":"Cliff beach in Carvoeiro Algarve Portugal","description":"Cliff beach located Carvoeiro near Vale de Milho","date":"2024-04-07T05:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/beaches/vale_centeanes.jpg","locations":["Lagoa","Carvoeiro","Vale de Milho"],"trip":"Beach Diversity","tags":["eating","hiking","swimming"],"draft":false,"activity":"Beach"},"content":"\nOne of the top beaches in Carvoeiro.

An easy walk to many of the villas that are for rent nearby in Vale de Milho Carvoeiro.   It is also in close proximity and easy walking distance to Rocha Brava Resort.  You have to walk down lots of steps to get to the beach.  People with less mobility may pass on this beach. Two tunnel were carved into the cliff to provide visitors access to the beach.

It also means that that seaweed tends to pile up sometimes on the beach making it difficult to get into the water to go for a swim.\n\n\n### \"How Busy\"\n\nLike some other cliff beaches it can get tight for a place to lay your beach blanket in the summer, especially during high tide.\n\n\n### Activities\"\n\nPlenty of activities to do at Carvalho beach.\n\n- Swimming\n- Sunbathing.
